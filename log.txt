- Things you need to do
1) finish the CRUD database operations
2) Link the CRUD ops to the end routes
3) Reference correctly the arguments in the db.py file
4) fix the arguments in db to link them to the models

- Things to discuss
1) ask if you need to do a table for base class in models/base.py

- Things made
1) tables done in user amenity city country & review.
2) made the get all method in db.py dont know if it works not tested yet.
3) Finished implementing CRUD in db.py it still needs to connect arguments in a way that
    the system recognizes is part of that class
4) found out that a way to use db in the project is to use alembic which is
    a migrating tool that takes the data and migrates it to databases
5) cannot make test work because of this error:
    sqlalchemy.exc.InvalidRequestError: When initializing mapper Mapper[Country(countries)],
    expression 'cities' failed to locate a name ('cities'). If this is a class name, consider adding this relationship()
    to the <class 'src.models.country.Country'> class after both dependent classes have been defined.
    try to fix this issue in order to see what is working and what is not
