- Things to discuss
1)

- Things made
1) tables done in user amenity city country & review.
2) made the get all method in db.py dont know if it works not tested yet.
3) Finished implementing CRUD in db.py it still needs to connect arguments in a way that
    the system recognizes is part of that class
4) found out that a way to use db in the project is to use alembic which is
    a migrating tool that takes the data and migrates it to databases
5) cannot make test work because of this error:
    sqlalchemy.exc.InvalidRequestError: When initializing mapper Mapper[Country(countries)],
    expression 'cities' failed to locate a name ('cities'). If this is a class name, consider adding this relationship()
    to the <class 'src.models.country.Country'> class after both dependent classes have been defined.
    try to fix this issue in order to see what is working and what is not
    a) Found this links for trying to solve issue https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid_cookbook/en/latest/database/sqlalchemy.html#importing-all-sqlalchemy-models & https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/narr/project.html#creating-a-project
6) Found out that the db runs through manage.py entry point not hbnb that one has to be for production and manage for development
7) fixed circular import on city and country and new problem where it initialized database 2 times
8) in memory repository manage your memory to select the type of storage using db or file
9) Database works! done with tasks 0 and 1 now going in to 2
10) have been adding little by little the requirements of task 02 left it on last step finish users.py/routes and add route method def protected():
    to the user.py in controllers
11) manage to fix a lot of issues and now it api requests works now i need to see if countries load from populate_db
12) remember to export REPOSITORY=db to use database before running app if you dont do that it wont work as intended
